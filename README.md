# 🍎 Smart Sorting – Healthy vs Rotten Fruits & Vegetables Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Smart Sorting is an AI-based web application that detects whether a fruit or vegetable is **Fresh** or **Spoiled** using Deep Learning image classification.  
Users upload an image and the system predicts quality with confidence score.

This project helps in:

- Automated food quality inspection
- Smart agriculture
- Food waste reduction
- Market quality checking
